Our asset files are designed to be used as a resource for our web-crawler, it simply scans through the list of open directories to grab file URLs and writes them to a Json file for use with the app.

You may notice that there's quite a lot of files here, that's because we prefer to seperate all directories for each sub-categories for listed files. There's currently an individual files for the following categories:
- Movies
- TV Shows
- Anime
- Subtitles
- Torrents
- Archives
