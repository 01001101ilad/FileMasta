# Contributing to the Database

We store a list of every server that we crawl for everyone to access. Adding severs is very easy, locate and edit *ftp-servers.txt* from this repo, add your server somewhere on a new line, and open a pull request. Your server will be added to the list and files will be available upon our next automatic scan by the robots crawler.

- Only direct server links are allowed e.g. *ftp://domain.com* or *ftp://192.0.2.64/pub*
- Credentials for authentication is supported e.g. *ftp://user:pass@192.0.2.64*
- No site listings under multiple domain names
- Do not submit incomplete or "Under Construction" servers
- Do not use URL shorteners in order to submit multiple servers
- No servers that include anything pornographic or in extremely bad taste
