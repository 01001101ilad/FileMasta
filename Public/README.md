# Contributing Servers to the Database

We store all our indexed servers in *ftp-servers.txt* so it's easy to implement new servers as time goes on. To add links, edit the file and add your server in the format below to a new line somewhere, click 'Commit' and we'll verify the request as soon as we can. All files will be available upon our next automatic scan by the [Web crawler](https://github.com/HerbL27/Web-Crawler)

- Only FTP servers are allowed e.g. *domain.com* or *192.0.2.64:52/pub* (default port is used if not specified) 
- Username/Passwords are allowed, just use hh default format e.g. *username:password@192.0.2.64*
- No site listings under multiple domain names
- Do not use URL shorteners in order to submit multiple links
- No links to anything pornographic or in extremely bad taste
