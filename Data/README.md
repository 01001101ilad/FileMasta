# Server List

Implementing new servers is easy, navigate and edit the file *ftp-servers.txt* from this directory, insert your server link on a new line, that's it. Just open a pull request and the files crawled from the server will be available once updated.

- Only direct server links are allowed e.g. *ftp://domain.com* or *ftp://192.0.2.64/pub*
- Credentials for authentication is supported e.g. *ftp://user:pass@192.0.2.64*
- No site listings under multiple domain names
- Do not submit incomplete or "Under Construction" servers
- Do not use URL shorteners in order to submit multiple servers
- No servers that include anything pornographic or in extremely bad taste
