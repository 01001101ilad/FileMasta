Search for Movies/TV shows available to watch for free

What is OpenPlex?

OpenPlex allows you to search for Movies/TV Shows available to watch online for free by providing you with trusted files from all around the web. But that's not all - we don't use torrents. Only direct raw media files hosted across the web, playable almost anywhere. Created by a few friends who wanted to come up with something different.

A database run by a community of movie lovers who are constantly uploading the links of the newly released movies as well as top classics, and of course we're open to suggestions.

If you've got any comments, queries or suggestions then simply open an issue - we want to know what you've got to say!

Some features available
• Simple interface, asynchronous tasks and threads for the best performance
• Huge database of files, over a thousand
• Search movies, files, people, years or filter by genre
• Support for streaming files in external players (Windows Media Player, MPC & VLC)
• Download files to your computer
• Local cache updating every 12 hours
• Collects metadata from OMDb & Popcorn Time

How does it work?

It communicates with its own community driven database to query files. Also including metadata collecting from both OMDb API and Popcorn Time Official API . Capability of opening files in both WMP, MPC & VLC Player (if installed) (support for others coming soon) and downloading multiple files asynchronously.

Contribute

Our core movie database is completely open source, which means anyone can submit links. It's not got the best structure at the moment but we're working to improve the feasibility so that it's a lot more easier to contribute towards. Just give us time. Oh, and you can follow this tutorial from GitHub if you're stuck.

Framework & Backend

The application is using .NET 4.6.2 WinForms Framework written in C#.

Legal Side of Things

All of the free movies/tv shows found on this app are hosted on third-party servers that are freely available to watch online for all internet users. Any legal issues regarding the free online links on this app should be taken up with the actual file hosts themselves, as we're not affiliated with them.

Comments

OpenPlex is a new application and is not a segment of Popcorn Time.
