## What is OpenTheatre?
OpenTheatre is a search engine that indexes open web directories to scrape movies, series, anime, subtitles and torrents files from all around the Internet.  

## Some features available
- Simple interface and background threads for the best performance
- Web crawler returning over 50,000 movies, series, anime, subtitles and torrents
- Search movies by people, years and genre
- Filter files by format, host and sort alphabetically
- Support for external players (Currently includes WMP, MPC & VLC. Open for requests!)
- Simple client for direct downloads
- Collects metadata from OMDb API & Popcorn Time API
- Local database updating every 12 hours

## How does it work?
It communicates with the open database to collect the latest movies available for streaming, along with some supported streams. We also use our custom built command-line application to query some of the public open movies directories. All of our databases are hosted here too, they can be found [here](https://github.com/invu/opentheatre-app/tree/master/assets).
