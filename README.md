## What is OpenPlex?

Just a small app still in early development. Basically allowing users to search the database filled with movies and tv shows from accross the web.

The database will eventually become open source so others can contribute and upload their own submission.

If you've got any comments, queries or suggestions for the app please just open an issue, I want to know what you've got to say!
