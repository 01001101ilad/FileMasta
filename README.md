## What is OpenTheatre?
OpenTheatre allows you to search for movies, series, anime, subtitles and torrents available hosted all over the Internet in public open directories. We've gathered all the appropriate files out there so you don't have to. Created by a few friends who wanted to come up with something different.

If you've got any comments, queries or suggestions then simply open an issue - we want to know what you've got to say!

## Some features available
- Simple interface, background tasks and threads for the best performance
- Supporting hundreds of open directories, looking for movies, series, anime, subtitles and torrents
- Search movies, files, people, years or filter by genre
- Support for streaming files in external players (Windows Media Player, MPC & VLC)
- Simple download client for direct downloads
- Local cache updating every 12 hours
- Collects metadata from OMDb & Popcorn Time

## How does it work?
It communicates with the [open database](https://github.com/invu/opentheatre-app/blob/master/assets/open-movies.txt) to collect the latest movies available for streaming, along with some supported streams. We also use our custom built command-line application to query some of the [public open movies directories](https://github.com/invu/opentheatre-app/blob/master/assets/open-movies-directories.txt), returning over 18,000 certified files! All of our other databases (series, anime, etc.) are hosted [here](https://github.com/invu/opentheatre-app/blob/master/assets/). Also includes movie metadata collecting from both [Open Movie Database API](https://omdbapi.com) and [Popcorn Time API](https://popcorntime.sh). Other features include opening files in both WMP, MPC & VLC Player and downloading multiple files asynchronously.
