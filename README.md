## What is OpenTheatre?
OpenTheatre is a search engine designed to index open web directories hosted all round the web to scrape movies, series, anime, subtitles and torrents. 

## Some features available
- Simple interface and background threads for the best performance
- Web crawler returning over 50,000 movies, series, anime, subtitles and torrents
- Search movies by people, years and genre
- Filter files by format, host and sort alphabetically
- Support for external players (Currently includes WMP, MPC & VLC - Open for requests)
- Simple client for direct downloads
- Collects metadata from OMDb API & Popcorn Time API
- Local database updating every 12 hours

## How does it work?
It communicates with the open database to collect the latest movies available for streaming, along with some supported streams. We also use our own custom built command-line application to query the public open movies directories to find the best possible files out there.
