## What is OpenPlex?
OpenPlex allows you to search for Movies/TV shows available to watch online for free by providing you with trusted files from all around the web. But we don't use torrents, just raw media files playable anywhere. Created by a few friends who wanted to come up with something different.

A database run by a community of movie lovers who are constantly uploading the links of the newly released movies as well as top classics, and of course we're open to suggestions.

If you've got any comments, queries or suggestions for the app please just open an issue - we want to know what you've got to say!

## How does it work?
It communicates with its own [API](https://github.com/invu/openplex-app/blob/master/Assets/openplex-db.txt) to query movies and tv shows from the community driven database. The app includes an easy-to-use download client, supporting all files and asynchronous downloads.

## Contribute
Got some direct media URLs lying around? Submit them to our [core movie database](https://github.com/invu/openplex-app/blob/master/Assets/openplex-db.txt)! It's pretty simple. Oh, and you can follow [this](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) tutorial from GitHub if you're stuck.

We're also hosting our [background database](https://github.com/invu/openplex-app/blob/master/Assets/openplex-backgrounds-db.txt) so you can add some awesome backgrounds to be displayed in the app!
