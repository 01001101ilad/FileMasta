## What is OpenTheatre?
OpenTheatre is a search engine designed to search and index files hosted among freely available web servers. It communicates with our own [Public Json File](https://dropbox.com/sh/bqb14ty282xm9xi/AACeniqYjhq2auw3KU3oNW2Fa?dl=0), which is updated daily by our robots that crawl through free access internet resources to list the best quality files it finds. All resources are available for everyone to browse in our [directories database](https://github.com/invu/opentheatre/tree/master/api), where users can submit open web directories. OpenTheatre hosts no content, we provide only access to already available files in a same way Google and other search engines do.
